Benito the giraffe arrived in Mexico's dry northern border city of Ciudad Juarez last month.

Already, the climate appears to be a problem. The creature has to deal with the heat of summer. And the snow and very cold temperatures of winter are still to come.

As a result, some animal activists are leading a social media campaign to "Save Benito." They seek to have the animal moved somewhere easier to live.

On a recent day, the 3-year-old male giraffe could be seen with only its head under a small, circular area for shade. The structure did little to protect him from a storm that came later in the day.

There is also a small building for the winter. But activists say it is cruel for the city-run Central Park to keep the giraffe in a small area, by himself, in a climate he is not used to.

Ana Félix said, "We have been fighting for a month, a group of animal activists, to demand that he be taken to an animal sanctuary, a zoo, ..." The Ciudad Juarez animal rights activist said Benito should be housed in the right space with people who know how to care for such animals.

Blue Hills, a sanctuary in Texas that rescues animals and books private tours to help offset the cost, has offered to buy or adopt Benito.

"We can offer him a ... new heated barn, so in the winter he doesn't stand in the snow and freeze," sanctuary worker Matt Lieberman wrote to The Associated Press. "We have an on-staff vet that cares for our animals and we have 24-hour staff for him."

He added that the giraffe would have 130 hectares to move around in. Lieberman said, "He needs trees to eat from and keep stimulated."

Benito appears to have just about finished off the only small trees within his reach at Central Park and can do little more than walk in circles.

Officials at the park reject the criticism, though they admit they cannot provide more trees. They say they are working to improve Benito's living area, saying his presence has been important in increasing the park's popularity among visitors, largely children. Monthly visits rose from about 140,000 before Benito arrived to 200,000.

Park visitor Derek Reyes, 11, had mixed feelings about Benito.

"He could be fine here," Reyes said, "but it would also be good if they could take him to a place where they belong, with a herd."

Park director Rogelio Muñoz said officials are planning to build Benito a new, heated winter house by September.

The park is also building a larger sun covering for the giraffe and cleaning water in the pool that takes up much of the enclosure. Benito will have fresh water in a special drinking container known as a trough.

"The conditions, attention and care in the habitat of the park's new resident are optimal for his stay," the park wrote in a social media message.

A zoo in the much milder climate of Sinaloa, a state on Mexico's northern Pacific coast, gave Benito to Ciudad Juarez's Central Park.

Benito could not stay with two other giraffes at the Sinaloa zoo because they were a couple. The male in the couple could become protective and attack the younger Benito.

The giraffe's arrival was a point of pride for Ciudad Juarez, a city across from El Paso, Texas. El Paso has giraffes at its zoo, the thinking goes, so why can't Ciudad Juarez?

"We want to be like El Paso," Muñoz said.


Researchers say a new method for heart transplants could increase the number of available organs and save more lives.

Currently, most transplanted hearts come from donors who have been declared brain dead. This means the person no longer has signs of brain function after suffering a serious injury. In a brain death, machines can keep the body breathing and can provide oxygen to organs until they can be recovered and put on ice.

But the new method would take hearts from medical cases known as circulatory deaths. These cases are also known as donation after circulatory death, or DCD.

Circulatory deaths happen when a person has a nonsurvivable brain injury, but still has some brain function. In these cases, family members can decide to withdraw all life support measures. This means organs go without oxygen for a time before they can be recovered.

Currently, kidneys and some other organs are taken from people suffering circulatory deaths. But doctors have resisted using hearts because of possible organ damage from a lack of oxygen.

A new study suggests that hearts might also be recoverable from cases of circulatory deaths. Researchers at North Carolina's Duke University School of Medicine led the study, which was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The researchers said using hearts from circulatory deaths could possibly give thousands more patients a chance at a lifesaving transplant. And it could increase the number of donor hearts by 30 percent.

"Honestly if we could snap our fingers and just get people to use this, I think it probably would go up even more than that," transplant doctor Jacob Schroder told The Associated Press. "This really should be standard of care," he said.

With the new method, doctors can remove hearts in circulatory deaths and put them in a machine that "reanimates" them. This process pumps blood and nutrients through the heart as they are being transported. The organs can also be tested to make sure they are effectively functioning before they are transplanted.

The study involved multiple hospitals around the country, as well as 180 transplant patients. Half the patients received DCD hearts and half were given hearts from brain-dead donors that were transported on ice.

Survival rates six months later were about the same – 94 percent for recipients of cardiac-death donations and 90 percent for those who got the usual hearts, the researchers reported.

The findings are exciting and show the possibility "to increase fairness and equity in heart transplantation..." said Dr. Nancy Sweitzer. She is a heart transplant specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. Sweitzer, who was not part of the study, said she thinks the new method will permit more people with heart failure to receive lifesaving treatment.

In the U.S. last year, 4,111 heart transplants were performed. While this was a record number, it is not nearly enough to meet the need. Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from advanced heart failure but many are never offered a transplant. Still others die waiting for one.


In a dirty street passage in the Senegalese city of Thies, Japanese wrestler Shogo Uozumi lay face-down in the sand.

He had just been thrown into the air by a larger opponent.

Uozumi then rose to his feet, cleaned himself off and rejoined the group of wrestlers.

Uozumi competed in Greco-Roman wrestling in Japan at a national level. Last year, he left Tokyo for Thies to master a Senegalese wrestling form known as Laamb. Now he is sharing his knowledge of the Olympic form of the sport with local wrestlers.

"Every time I train, I feel myself getting stronger," he said. "I feel a lot of joy and growth within me."

Laamb has its beginnings in ancient war ceremonies. It has gone from a traditional activity that takes place after crops are harvested to become Senegal's national sport. Laamb mixes physical combat and acrobatics. Victory is marked when an opponent's back touches the ground.

Uozumi discovered the style of wrestling during a trip to Senegal with Japan's aid agency in 2017. He was interested by the country's cultural similarities to Japan such as the importance of hospitality.

Since moving to Senegal in 2022, Uozumi has lived with a community of wrestlers in Thies, Senegal's third largest city. He has also set up a school with about 36 students. He is helping them prepare for the 2026 Youth Olympics.

Cheikh Badiane is a Laamb wrestler and one of Uozumi's closest friends.

"He showed me what it means to commit oneself, to leave one's country without being well-paid, knowing that he would only have enough to live on, to develop our sport," Badiane said.

"I would help him whatever it cost me."

Uozumi and Badiane coached wrestlers at a national competition last month in Saint-Louis, Senegal's colonial capital. Hundreds of people came to watch.

One of Uozumi and Badiane's students went home with the silver medal in her weight class.

"Senegalese people live together, with their families, their friends, and they all support each other in this way," Uozumi said on returning to Thies. "That's my kind of culture."

And now, Words and Their Stories from VOA Learning English!

Americans often try to say things as quickly as possible. So, for some expressions, we use the first letters of the words instead of saying each word. Many common expressions or long names are shortened this way.

B-Y-O-B is a short way of saying, “Bring Your Own Bottle.”

The letters BYOB are often found at the bottom of a written invitation to a simple social event or gathering of friends. For example, let’s say I had a New Year’s Eve party. I might include on the invitation, “Please come to my party and BYOB.” The bottle each person brings is what the person wants to drink at the party or wants to share.

However, an invitation to a special event – such as a wedding --would never say BYOB.

An invitation to an official or very special event often has other letters written at the bottom. The letters are R-S-V-P.

These letters represent the French expression, “Repondez S’il Vous Plait.” In English the words mean, “Respond If It Pleases You.” Americans use the letters as a short way to say, “Please answer this invitation.”

Another expression usually used for business and not parties is A-S-A-P. So, a colleague might say she needs something done ASAP. It means as soon as possible. She might also need something done by C-O-B. That means she wants to finish it by “Close Of Business” or the end of the work day.

Beginning letters are often used to represent the names of universities.

A famous one is MIT. That is short for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Another major university is UCLA. Almost no one ever says its real name, the University of California at Los Angeles. That takes way too long!

Many American government agencies are also known by their beginning letters. For example, the F-B-I is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI investigates criminal activity in the United States. Then there is the I-R-S, the Internal Revenue Service. It is not a very popular agency because it collects federal taxes.

And that’s all for Voice of America’s Words and Their Stories. Or maybe I should just say VOA’s WATS.

Until next time

Drones Monitor Whale Health In Australia

A water-proof drone is being used by Australian scientists to collect the highly-treasured nasal mucus of migrating whales. The snot is rich with fresh DNA, viruses and bacteria, and is collected by a drone that hovers over the blowholes of humpback whales as they embark on their epic annual journey along Australia's east coast. From Sydney, Phil Mercer reports.

Whales, like all mammals need air, and come to the surface to breathe through a blowhole.

Vanessa Pirotta, a marine biologist at Macquarie University, says that nasal mucus indicates the health of the whale.

FILE - A humpback whale breaches off the coast at Clovelly Beach in Sydney, Australia, June 19, 2016.“It is the juicy biological mixture that you see as a whale takes a breath as they surface from the water," she said. "You often see that plume and it sounds like this like [sounds of sharp breaths] as a whale breathes because, after all, they are mammals like you and I and they have two nostrils, and it is the humpback whale that I am talking about. So as they take a breath it is a lot of lung bacteria coming out from their lungs, which we can collect to provide a snapshot of whale health.”

Australian researchers have attached a petri dish that is used in scientific tests to a drone which flies through the whale’s nasal mist.

Vanessa Pirotta again.

“As a whale comes to take a breath — you can actually see it coming to the surface on really good weather days that is — the drone then lowers, the petri dish is then opened and the drone is flown through the densest part of the whale snot, collecting the sample in the petri dish. Now once this happens the lid is shut and the drone is flown back to the research vessel and we collect the sample to later process it in the laboratory.”

The research could help to solve one of the mysteries of another magnificent creature of the deep — the Southern right whale. Its numbers have recovered on Australia’s west coast since hunting was outlawed but its population on the eastern seaboard remains stubbornly low.

In the past studies into whale health had to rely on examining whales that were either killed or those whales that had been stranded on a beach.

Drones allow scientists to collect samples from free-swimming whales to gather information in a safe and non-invasive way.

Lady Gaga Helps Schools in Communities Affected by Mass Shootings

Children from three communities affected by the latest mass shootings in the United States are starting a new school year. Singer Lady Gaga is trying to make their return to school a little happier and easier.

The Grammy-winning singer recently announced she would pay for several schoolroom projects in the cities of El Paso, Texas, Dayton, Ohio, and Gilroy, California.

In El Paso, there are new books for third-grade students, many of whom do not have any books at home. In Dayton, students with disabilities will have special chairs to help them stay calm. In Gilroy, fifth-graders are getting fun new tools for their science lessons.

Gaga’s aim is to bring a measure of hope to places affected by an especially violent week of mass killings. She wrote on her Facebook page, “I want to channel my confusion, frustration, and fury into hope.”

The money for the projects came from the singer’s Born This Way Foundation, in partnership with the nonprofit group DonorsChoose.

Back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton a week ago left 31 dead. Three more were killed when a gunman opened fire at a celebration in Gilroy the weekend before.

The dead included three school-aged young people. A 6-year-old boy, Stephen Romero, was playing at the Gilroy Garlic Festival when he was killed. A 13-year-old girl, Keyla Salazar, also was killed in Gilroy.

And, 15-year-old Javier Amir Rodriguez died in the shooting at an El Paso Walmart store. Many of the victims had gone to Walmart to buy supplies for the upcoming school year.

The DonorsChoose website says it “connects teachers in high-needs communities with donors who want to help.”

A public school teacher from New York City started the organization in 2000. He had wanted his students to read the famous American book Little House on the Prairie. But, he only had enough money to buy a single copy of the book for the classroom.

Gaga promised to pay for 162 school projects, including requests made by teachers from 125 classrooms in El Paso, 14 classrooms in Dayton and 23 classrooms in Gilroy. Other donors had already partly paid for some of the projects.

Among those that Gaga chose to fully finance is a $462 request for books at El Paso’s Whitaker Elementary School. Rebeca Blanco-Grijalva wrote in her appeal on DonorsChoose that she teaches third grade at a poor school. She described her students as “voracious readers.” But many of them do not have any books of their own to read at home.

That will soon change.

Another project hopes to help students with special needs at a school in Dayton. The $862 project will provide a room with an “active chair,” “wobble chair” and other furniture. The teacher of the class wrote on DonorsChoose, “My students live hard lives and come to school looking for love as much as they do an education.”

Gaga wrote on Facebook that the money for these and other projects will give teachers “the support they need to inspire their students to work together and bring their dreams to life.”

The United States space agency, NASA, says its Mars exploration vehicle recently recorded a high level of methane gas on the planet. The discovery is exciting because the presence of methane gas could support the case for life on Mars.

NASA’s Curiosity vehicle recently recorded the largest level of methane ever measured during its seven-year Mars mission.

Methane has no color or smell. A special instrument on Curiosity’s Mars Science Laboratory recorded the increased gas level. The device, called a laser spectrometer, measures levels of chemical elements and gases in the Martian atmosphere. In addition to methane, the instrument can record levels of water and carbon dioxide.

Nearly all the methane gas found in Earth’s atmosphere is produced by biological activity. It usually comes from animal and plant life. But it can also be formed by geological processes, such as interactions between rocks and water.

NASA said the increased methane was measured to be about 21 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). One ppbv means that if you take a volume of air on Mars, one billionth of the volume of air is methane.

It was not the first time Curiosity has found methane gas in the Martian atmosphere. About a year ago, NASA announced that Curiosity had discovered sharp seasonal increases in the gas.

This time, NASA said the measured methane gas level was clearly larger than any others observed in the past. NASA officials even temporarily stopped Curiosity’s other activities to investigate further.

“It's exciting because microbial life is an important source of methane on Earth,” NASA said in a statement announcing the discovery.

However, Curiosity’s team carried out a follow-up methane experiment that showed a sharp drop in levels of the gas. The second examination found the level was less than one part per billion by volume. That number was “close to the background levels Curiosity sees all the time,” NASA said.

The rise and fall of the methane gas levels left NASA scientists with more questions than answers. The scientists are continuing to study possible causes for the sudden increase.

"The methane mystery continues," said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "We're more motivated than ever to keep measuring and put our brains together to figure out how methane behaves in the Martian atmosphere."

Curiosity does not have instruments that can exactly identify whether the source of the methane is biological or geological. One leading theory is that methane is being released from underground areas created by possible life forms that disappeared long ago.

Even though Mars has no active volcanoes, scientists believe it is also possible that methane is being produced by reactions involving carbon materials and water.

A clearer understanding of methane levels over time “could help scientists determine where they're located on Mars,” NASA said. Scientists hope this understanding will come as Curiosity continues to collect methane data in its search for possible life.

One of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S state of Louisiana is moving inland, flooding coast areas and cutting powers to more than half million people. Meteorologists say Ida has weaken slightly, but they warned its slow progress northward has increased its destructive potential. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from the gulf coast.

American military officials say they are confident that an airstrike on a vehicle in the Afghan capital Kabul hit the intended target, a suicide bomber who is about to attack the airport. It was the second American drone strike on an IS target since Thursday, when around 170 people died in the suicide attack in Kabul.

The UN nuclear watchdog says North Korea appears to have restated its nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy agency says the Yongbyon nuclear plant has been discharging cooling water since July, suggesting it’s operational.

A boat carrying 80 people in Peru's Amazon region has sunk after crashing into an oil barge. 20 people have died, and 50 others are missing.

The Chilean president Sebastián Piñera has defended his decision to issue at a decree, claiming a larger sweep of the ocean. Argentina accused Chile of encroaching into the territorial waters and trying to seize part of the continental shelf.

The American actor Ed Asner who starred in the Mary Tyler Moore Show has died. He was 91. Asner became well-known across the U.S of playing Lou Grant, a grouchy journalist who's given his own spin-off TV drama in the 1970s and 80s.

And the Argentine football star Lionel Messi has made his highly anticipated debut for the Paris Saint Germain three weeks after signing for the club. Messi came off the bench on the 66 minute of the PSG’s away game against Reims in the French league.

Welcoming our viewers around the world to the last broadcast of our Spring season. Fridays are awesome.

Many Americans have a three-day weekend coming up. Since 1971. the Memorial Day Holiday has been observed on the last Monday in May. It's come to symbolize the unofficial beginning of summer. A time of cookouts and family reunions, a time when Americans can wear white shoes again according to an old-fashioned fashion rule. But the true meaning of the holiday is in remembrance, Memorial Day is a tribute to all Americans who died serving in their nation's conflicts. It started during the Civil War when mourners used flowers to decorate the graves of those who'd been killed in battle.

That gave rise to the holiday known as Decoration Day. It was marked in states that fought for the Union and the Confederacy. After World War I, which ended in 1918. the holiday's name was changed to Memorial Day and it became a time to remember servicemen and women who'd been lost in every war. Flags are placed in their honor. Parades and church services, public events are held. The president traditionally lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. That can take place on Veterans Day as well. But while that holiday recognizes everyone who served in the Armed Forces, Memorial Day focuses on those who gave their lives in service.

The respects paid at Arlington are mirrored in cemeteries and communities all across America. This year Memorial Day coincides with another historic date. One of America's worst outbreaks of racial violence occurred on May 31st, 1921. It's known as the Tulsa Race Massacre or the Tulsa Race Riot.

Historians believe it started with an accusation against a black man. A confrontation between black and white mobs. The fatal shooting of a white protestor and then widespread destruction of an African American neighborhood of Tulsa, Oklahoma. There's a lot of mystery around it. No one knows who actually fired the first shot. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, estimates of the number killed range from 30 to 300. mostly African Americans. 

A Facebook hack from two years ago is what leads off today's show. Why are we covering this now? Because the information from more than 530 million Facebook accounts has just been noticed on a hacker Website.

By the summer of 2019. more than 2.4 billion people were active on Facebook every month. That's the time when the company says it found and fixed a flaw in its system that had allowed hackers to get the personal information of hundreds of millions. Facebook ID's, relationship status', bios, birthdays, all of this could be compromised.

Cyber security experts say the leaked information probably doesn't include social security numbers or credit card numbers which are most useful to hackers and identity thieves. But analysts say this is a reminder that no information that people share with online services can ever be guaranteed to stay private and that people should only ever share what they would accept appearing in a public database somewhere down the line.

As far as sharing personal info goes like your password, credit card and social security numbers, security officials say you should only do that if you have personally started the conversation or transaction not if a person or organization randomly asks you for it.

It is hardly necessary for me to cite all the evidence of the depressing state of literacy. These figures from the Department of Education are sufficient: 27 million Americans cannot read at all. and a further 35million read al a level that is less than sufficient to survive in our society.

　　But my own worry today is fess that of the overwhelming problem of elemental literacy than it is of the slightly more luxurious problem of the decline in the skill even of the middle-class reader, of his unwillingness to afford those spaces of silence. those luxuries of domesticity and time and concentration, that surround the image of the classic act of reading. n has been suggested that almost 80 percent of America's literate, educated teenagers can no longer read without an accompanying noise (music) in the background or a television screen flickering (闪烁) at the corner of their field of perception. We know very little about the brain and how it deals with simultaneous conflicting input, but every common-sense intuition suggests we should be profoundly alarmed. This violation of concentration} silence, solitude (独处的状态) goes tothe very heart of our notion of literacy; this new form of part-reading, of part-perception against background distraction renders impossible certain essential acts of apprehension and concentration, let alone that most important tribute any human being can pay to a poem or a piece of prose he or she really loves, which is to learn it by heart. Not by brain. by heart; the expression is vital.

　　Under these circumstances. the question of what future there is for the arts of reading is a real one. Ahead of us lie technical. psychic(心理的). and social transformations probably much more dramatic than thosebrought about by Gutenberg, the German inventor in printing. The Gutenberg revolution. as we now know it, took a long time; its effects are still being debated. The information revolution will touch every fact ofcomposition. publication. distribution. and reading. No one in the book industry can say with any confidence what will

　　happen to the book as we've known it.

People today can move markets and build or destroy reputation.With the ubiquity of the Internet and round-the-clock news and information, consumers can easily praise or punish brands and the companies behind them. Armed with an overabundance of data, purchasers have tremendous influence over what their friends or families buy and even what strangers buy.

　　What sources move consumers? Not surprisingly, word of mouth is the leading influence (88%) when it comes to impacting consumers' opinion of a company, whether its genesis is online or offline. Conversations where company likes and dislikes are discussed are no longer out of the ordinary for the general public. What is noteworthy is the power of online reviews (83%) and online search results (81%) in determining what people say about companies and the brands they make. Online reviews are nearly as important as word of mouth in determining perceptions and impacting public opinion. There is no doubt that user-generated online reviews such as those found on recommendation sites (such as amazon.com, TripAdvisor or Yelp in the U.S. and U.K., TaoBao, Ctrip and Dianping in China, and Buscape and ReclameAQUI in Brazil) have fast-become omnipotent arbiters of brand trust and company assurance.

　　News sources and company websites are also highly influential for learning about companies (79% and 74%, respectively). For those who doubt the influence of company websites in favor of other channels, this study reinforces their value as a gateway to company reputation.

　　Other notable sources of influence on company perceptions include awards and rankings (63%), leadership communications (59%) and advertising (56%) -- all cited by over one half of consumers surveyed. As it has been said before, consumers are searching for confirmation that the company behind the brand is endorsed by others, reinforced from top to bottom and vocal.

　　Social networks, on the other hand, were rated as having the least influence (49%) on company opinion by consumers. The reason for this is probably due to the fact that most companies have yet to fully embrace social media in a way that resonates and truly engages the increasingly cynical public. However, we all know that the influence of social networks is growing fast. Once companies figure out how to best use social media to demonstrate their receptivity and customer focus, social media will be the consumer's best friend.

Now that we have doubled the number of young people arttending college, a diploma cannot even guarantee a job. The most charirable conclusion we can reach is that college probably has very little, if any, effect on people and things at all. Today, the false premises are easv to see:

　　First,college doesn't make people intelligent, ambitious, happy or liberal. It's the other way around. Intelligent, ambitious, happy, liberal people are arttracted to higher education in the first place.

　　Second,college can't claim much credit for the learning experiences that really change students while theyare there. Jobs, history, and most of all. the sheer passage of time, have as big an impact as anything even indirectly related to the campus.

　　Third, colleges have changed so radically that a freshman entering in the fall or 1974 can't be sure to gain even the limited value research studies assigned to colleges in the 60s. The sheer size of undergraduate campuses of the 1970s makes college even less stimulating now than it was 10 years ago. Today even motivated students are disappointed with their college courses and professors.

　　Finally,a college diploma no longer opens as many vocational doors.Employers are beginning to realize thatwhen they pay cxtra for someone with a diploma, they are paying only for an empty credential. The fact is that most of the work for which employers now expect college training is now or has been capably done in the past by people without higher education.

　　College, then, may be a good place for those few young people who are really drawn to academic work. who would rather read than eat, but it has become too expensive, in money, time, and intellectual effort to serve as a holding pen for large numbers of our young. We ought to make it possible for those reluctant, unhappy students to find alternative ways of growing up, and more realistic preparation for the years ahead.

As much of the world pays close attention to the slow progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive, its leaders are trying to tamp down expectations, saying that the fight to expel the Russian invaders was inevitably going to be a hard, bloody slog, not a lightning advance.

“Some people want some sort of a Hollywood movie, but things don’t really happen that way,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday, when asked in a BBC interview about the attitudes of the allies supplying Ukraine with weapons.

“We would definitely like to make bigger steps,” he said, according to a transcript provided by the BBC, but he insisted that he remained confident and suggested that expectations of rapid success were unrealistic. Allies may try to pressure Ukraine, but “with all due respect, nothing will depend on that opinion,” Mr. Zelensky told the BBC’s Yalda Hakim. “We will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best.”

The counteroffensive in southeastern Ukraine, now in its third week, has so far recaptured only a smattering of villages in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, with progress often measured in yards, not miles. Ukraine’s forces are also trying to advance around the Russian-held city of Bakhmut, in Donetsk. At the same time, Russian forces have attempted to go on the offensive elsewhere in Donetsk and the Luhansk region, potentially diverting Ukrainian resources.

Military analysts have said that it would take weeks or months, not days, to gauge the success of Ukraine’s offensive, and warned that the fight would be long and bloody. But anticipation over the operation, including among allies, has been building as Ukraine spent months amassing a powerful arsenal of Western-supplied weapons and training tens of thousands of soldiers for the campaign.

said his government needed to show progress to motivate both its own troops and its foreign backers. Officials in Kyiv and some of their supporters abroad worry that if the long-anticipated counteroffensive does not produce significant gains, then the Western allies might lose patience with pouring billions of dollars into the war, and pressure Ukraine to reach a negotiated settlement that would leave Russia holding vast tracts of conquered lands.

The president’s remarks echoed those of other Ukrainian officials, who have said for weeks that the counteroffensive was going to move slowly — though perhaps not as slowly as it has. Hanna Malyar, a deputy defense minister, said on Tuesday evening that gains so far were less than some had hoped, but that Ukraine’s forces were advancing “in small steps.”

The terrain in Ukraine’s south is unforgiving for attackers, with wide open fields and little high ground, and Ukrainian troops are meeting staunch resistance from Russian forces. The Russians have had months to construct multilayered defenses — minefields, tank obstacles, trenches, bunkers and gun emplacements — in the areas they occupy.

Defensively they know how to hold their ground,” said a soldier fighting for Ukraine, who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons. He added that Russian entrenchments have frequently been well built.

While Ukraine has not disclosed losses, analysts have said its attacks on Russian lines are likely taking a heavy toll on Kyiv’s forces and on their newly supplied Western tanks and armored vehicles. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine’s casualties, while heavy, have been lower than Russia’s, according to Western estimates, but going on the offensive generally means taking more losses.

The Ukrainians, probing for weaknesses to attack with forces still held in reserves, are struggling to breach the initial lines of defense, with miles to go before the main defensive lines are encountered.

“They haven’t committed a significant chunk of their forces yet, so the pace is not surprising,” Seth Jones, a defense expert focused on the war at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview. “If they were to throw everything in right now and the pace were slow, that would be problematic.

Throughout the war, Russia’s superior fleets of warplanes and attack helicopters have avoided Ukrainian-controlled air space for fear of being shot down, but the Ukrainian advance offers them new opportunities.

“This is one of the few times the Russians can bring air power to bear against exposed Ukrainian forces,” Mr. Jones said.

Last September, Ukrainian forces, exploiting an area of Russian weakness, were able to recapture a large swath of the northeastern Kharkiv region with astonishing speed. Advancing at a more measured pace, they retook the southern city of Kherson and neighboring areas in November. But those offensives did not have to overcome as formidable a set of defenses as the Ukrainians now face, and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov warned against drawing comparisons.

“It is impossible to expect that everything will happen as quickly as it was with Kharkiv, because the front line is completely different, and the terrain, and weather conditions,” he said in an interview this week with Current Time TV. “Plus, the Russians had the opportunity to prepare. There is an incredible density of minefields.”

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested on Wednesday that Ukraine’s losses were contributing to “a certain lull” in the fighting, and expressed certainty about an ultimate Russian victory. However, he said that Ukraine’s “offensive potential has not been exhausted,” and that Kyiv was considering how and where to deploy its reserves.

His comments — to a state television reporter, on the sidelines of a Kremlin event — were the latest instance of Mr. Putin seeking to project confidence publicly and to underscore his insistence that Russia has the resources to outlast and exhaust Ukraine and the West.

For nearly a century, only cats (and presumably the rats they kept at bay) had free rein over an ancient archaeological site in the heart of central Rome. They would prowl among the ruins and preen for the tourists who gathered along the balustrades above, cellphones and cameras in hand.

But as of Tuesday, human visitors were allowed for the first time to descend and get a better glimpse of the site, believed to be where Julius Caesar was brutally assassinated by a group of senators in 44 B.C. The spot is nestled in an area with four temples, rare remnants of the Roman Republic, dating from the fourth to the first centuries B.C.

The full site, called the Sacred Area of Largo di Torre Argentina, is the latest addition to Rome’s rich archaeological offerings. The Italian capital’s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, said at the inauguration on Monday that the attraction would add “tremendous value to a city that never ceases to amaze with its treasures and wonders.” Rome was discovering “its history to the fullest,” he added.

There is no X-marks-the-spot where Julius Caesar met his bloody end on — as tradition and the Shakespeare play “Julius Caesar” would have it — the Ides of March, about the 15th day of the month. The spot contains just a jumble of limestone rocks, bricks and tufts of grass.

was actually assassinated at the Curia of Pompey, a large rectangular meeting hall where the Senate of Rome met occasionally. The emperor Augustus later declared the hall a “locus sceleratus,” or “cursed place,” and it was walled up.

But Shakespeare “could get away with” a little artistic license, Ms. Ceci laughed.

On the opposite side of the site, marble decorations and sculptures, for decades stored unseen in Rome’s archaeological warehouses, have been displayed in a long hall under the modern-day street. “It’s one thing to keep them in order on shelves, quite another to tell the history of this site through these fragments,” Ms. Ceci said.

Irina Lumsden, a data engineer visiting Rome from Melbourne, Australia, said that the site was transporting. “It’s amazing, you get such a feeling of ancient time here,” she said “They’ve done a great job of conserving the site.”

The area was rediscovered during excavations from 1926 to 1929, when the square was being demolished to make way for new buildings. The four temples unearthed were initially labeled with the first four letters of the alphabet because archaeologists were unsure which temples they had uncovered. Now they have been tentatively identified, though there is still scholarly debate: the Temple of Juturna, after a goddess of fountains, wells and springs, dating from the mid-third century B.C.; the Temple of Fortuna Huiusce Diei, or Fortune of the Present Day, built in the second century B.C.; the Temple of Feronia, a goddess of fertility, built about the end of the fourth century B.C.; and the Temple of Lares Permarini, dedicated to the protectors of navigation, or according to others to the Nymphs, and constructed in the early second century

After a fire devastated this part of Rome in A.D. 80, the emperor Domitian restored the temples and a travertine slab floor, still visible, was built on top of the surrounding rubble.

Over the centuries, the area underwent various further transformations, remaining buried until the excavations in the 1920s. City officials at the time immediately understood the value of the archaeological find, and the site was closed off, to be admired only from above.

Monica Baraschi, a volunteer with a cat sanctuary that abuts one corner of the ancient site, said that even the feline residents — there were 86, she said — would feel some benefits from the opening up of the spot and the arrival of visitors.

“They’ll get cuddled and caressed — the cats will be happy,” she said.

In the past, there has been friction between archaeologists and the sanctuary. Ms. Ceci, the archaeologist, said that the cats had been “good workmates” during the two years that the site was undergoing work to prepare for the opening.

Visitors on the first day also seemed glad to see a bit of ancient Rome up close. Simeon Peebler, a software engineer from Chicago, said, “In a world of virtual-reality experiences, to have a real reality experience is amazing.”

Romans were equally delighted. Sandro Lubattelli, a retired computer engineer and his wife, Rossana Cipressi, a retired teacher, said that they had spent a lifetime looking at the site from above and were thrilled to finally be able to go in.

“We always wondered why it was closed,” Mr. Lubattelli said. “We’re in seventh heaven.”

N EARLY September President
Xi Jinping will take the salute
at a huge military parade in Beijing. It will be his most visible assertion of authority since he
came to power in 2012: his first
public appearance at such a display of missiles, tanks and
goose-steppingtroops. Officially the event will be all about the
past, commemorating the end of the second world war in 1945
and remembering the 15m Chinese people who died in one of
its bloodiest chapters: the Japanese invasion and occupation
ofChina of1937-45.
It will be a reminder of the bravery of China’s soldiers and
their crucial role in confronting Asia’s monstrously aggressive
imperial power. And rightly so: Chinese sacrifices during that
hellish period deserve much wider recognition. Between 1937,
when total war erupted in China, and late 1941, when the attack on Pearl Harbor brought America into the fray, China
fought the Japanese alone. By the end of the war it had lost
more people—soldiers and civilians—than any other country
bar the Soviet Union.
Yet next month’s parade is not just about remembrance; it is
about the future, too. This is the first time that China is commemorating the war with a military show, rather than with
solemn ceremony. The symbolism will not be lost on its neighbours. And it will unsettle them, for in East Asia today the rising, disruptive, undemocratic power is no longer a string of islands presided over by a god-emperor. It is the world’s most
populous nation, led by a man whose vision for the future (a
richer country with a stronger military arm) sounds a bit like
one of Japan’s early imperial slogans. It would be wrong to
press the parallel too far: China is not about to invade its neighbours. But there are reasons to worry about the way the Chinese Communist Party sees history—and massages it to justify
its current ambitions. 
History with Chinese characteristics
Under Mr Xi, the logic ofhistory goes something like this. China played such an important role in vanquishing Japanese imperialism that not only does it deserve belated recognition for
past valour and suffering, but also a greater say in how Asia is
run today. Also, Japan is still dangerous. Chinese schools, museums and TV programmes constantly warn that the spirit of
aggression still lurks across the water. A Chinese diplomat has
implied that Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is a new Voldemort, the epitome ofevil in the “Harry Potter” series. At any
moment Japan could menace Asia once more, party newspapers intone. China, again, is standing up to the threat.
As our essay on the ghosts of the war that ended 70 years
ago this week explains (see page 33), this narrative requires exquisite contortions. For one thing, it was not the Chinese communists who bore the brunt of the fighting against Japan, but
their sworn enemies, the nationalists (or Kuomintang) under
Chiang Kai-shek. For another, today’s Japan is nothing like the
countrythat slaughtered the inhabitants ofNanjing, forced Korean and Chinese women into military brothels or tested biological weapons on civilians. 
Granted, Japan never repented of its war record as fullthroatedly as Germany did. Even today a small but vocal
group of Japanese ultra-nationalists deny their country’s war
crimes, and Mr Abe, shamefully, sometimes panders to them.
Yet the idea that Japan remains an aggressive power is absurd.
Its soldiers have not fired a shot in anger since 1945. Its democracy is deeply entrenched; its respect for human rights profound. Most Japanese acknowledge their country’s war guilt.
Successive governments have apologised, and Mr Abe is expected to do the same (see page 32). Today Japan is ageing,
shrinking, largely pacifist and, because of the trauma of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, unlikely ever to possess nuclear weapons. Some threat.
The dangers ofdemonisation
China’s demonisation of Japan is not only unfair; it is also
risky. Governmentsthatstoke up nationalistanimosity cannot
always control it. So far, China’s big show of challenging Japan’s control of the Senkaku (or Diaoyu) islands has involved
onlysabre-rattling, notbloodshed. Butthere isalways a danger
that a miscalculation could lead to something worse. 
EastAsia’sold warwoundshave notyethealed. The Korean
peninsula remains sundered, China and Taiwan are separate,
and even Japan can be said to be split, for since 1945 America
has used the southern island of Okinawa as its main military
stronghold in the western Pacific. The Taiwan Strait and the
border between North and South Korea continue to be potential flashpoints; whether they one day turn violent depends
largely on China’s behaviour, for better or worse. It is naive to
assume America will always be able to keep a lid on things. 
On the contrary, many Asians worry that China’s ambitions set it on a collision course with the superpower and the
smaller nations that shelter under its security umbrella. When
China picks fights with Japan in the East China Sea, or builds
airstrips on historically disputed reefs in the South China Sea,
it feeds those fears. It also risks sucking America into its territorial disputes, and raises the chances ofeventual conflict.
Post-war East Asia is not like western Europe. No NATO or
European Union binds former foes together. France’s determination to promote lasting peace by uniting under a common
set of rules with Germany, its old invader, has no Asian equivalent. East Asia is therefore less stable than western Europe: a
fissile mix ofcountries both rich and poor, democratic and authoritarian, with far less agreement on common values or
even where their borders lie. Small wonder Asians are skittish
when the regional giant, ruled by a single party that draws little distinction between itself and the Chinese nation, plays up
themes ofhistorical victimhood and the need to correct for it. 
How much betterit would be ifChina sought regional leadership not on the basis of the past, but on how constructive its
behaviour is today. If Mr Xi were to commit China to multilateral efforts to foster regional stability, he would show that he
has truly learned the lessons of history. That would be far, far
better than repeating it.

sio, the city’s leftish mayor since last year.
In December and then again in January
theyturned theirbackson him atthe funerals of officers murdered by an man who
claimed to be angered by police violence.
Since then, supporters of the police—such
as the New York Post, a scrappy tabloid—
have alleged that Mr de Blasio’s reduction
of the use of stop-and-frisk tactics has contributed to an increase in the murder rate
so far this year. That is a stretch: although
the numberofmurdersin NewYorkhas increased, the number of shootings so far
this year has remained the same.
Police anger could be a factor in crime
spikes, says Eugene O’Donnell, an academic at the John Jay College of Criminal
Justice. Cops who feel they have less political support may become inclined to do the
bare minimum. But another, more subtle,
effect may also be at play, he says. Most inner-city murders are not sophisticated—
they often take place in crowded streets.
Yet clearance rates remain stunningly low.
In Baltimore, just 36% of murders have
been solved this year, compared with twothirds nationally. Cops who are distrusted
struggle to find co-operative witnesses,
many of whom fear retaliation if they are
deemed to be “snitches”. The message that
cops are sometimes racist or too violent,
even when accurate, may be making it
harder for them to do their jobs properly.
Once the killings start they are hard to
stop. In a city such as Baltimore, where
graffiti on the walls of abandoned houses
commemorate dead young men, murders
lead to retaliatory murders. Much violent
crime is spontaneous: according to analysis by the city’s police department given to
the Baltimore Sun, only 14% of murder victims in 2014, and only11% ofsuspects, were
gang members. More detailed analysis by
Milwaukee’s Homicide Review Commission, an advisory board, suggests that in
that city arguments are by far the biggest
known cause of murders. When the
chance ofgettingcaught is low, and the law
is not trusted, violence reigns.
Such cities have remained intensely
violent even as crime in general has declined. Last year, before the spike, more
than one in 100 black men aged 15 to 24 in
Milwaukee got shot; roughly one in ten of
those was killed. Studies of homicide victimssuggestthatmostmurdervictims (and
perpetrators) come from a tiny number of
young men, almost all with criminal convictions, who tend to know each other.
One study of a high-crime community in
Boston found that 85% of gunshot victims
came from a network of just 763 young
men—or less than 2% of the local population. Murder, it seems, is a disease that
spreads through social interaction.
If the leap in violence proves lasting,
that ought to worry reformers. Since the
protests in Ferguson began, improving
America’s policing and prison systems has
united most Democrats and some Republicans. Hillary Clinton used one of her first
speeches as a presidential candidate to call
for prison and police reform. Congress is
expected to consider sentencing reform in
the autumn. That cause, however, has
been helped by low and falling crime. The
case may be harder to make if cities are no
longer seen to be improving.
The rhetoric of some politicians is already shifting. In April Elijah Cummings,
who represents part of Baltimore in Congress, said that police reform “is the civil
rights cause of this generation”. On August
3rd, announcing a new partnership between the city’s police and federal agencies, he took a different tone. “I hear over
and overand overagain, blacklives matter,
black lives matter. And they do matter. But
blacklives also have to matterto black people.” He had a simpler message for killers:
“You’re not going to get away with it.
ITS
prospectusdeclaresthatOne57 will redefine luxury New York living; its bland
interiors are, apparently, the acme of Danish modernism. The best condominiums
in the building are said to sell for $100m.
Strangely, the sales pitch does not mention
that this luminous skyscraper beside Central Park benefited from tax breaks generously provided by New York city. Uncertainty about the future of that handout
helps to explain whythe cityis in the midst
ofa building boom.
After collapsing in 2009, demand for
residential building permits has been risingsteadily forfive years, and lately has begun to surge (see chart). Census figures
show that developers for residential buildings secured permits for nearly 42,000 units in the first six months of 2015 alone—
more than double the number issued in
the whole of 2014. Almost half these units
are slated for Brooklyn, where land is less
dear than on Manhattan. 
The cityneedsthe housing. The population has swollen to 8.4m, up nearly 3%
since 2010, but the housing stock has not
kept up. A tight market with few vacancies
(a 3.45% rate in 2014) has been pushing up
prices. The median rent paid in the city
grew by 12% between 2005 and 2013, after
adjusting for inflation, according to NYU’s
Furman Centre on housing policy. More
than 12% of all rental housing is now considered overcrowded, according to the
city’s latest Housing Supply Report.
Yet growing demand does not entirely
explain this surge in promised supply.
Building permits in June alone rivalled the
number issued in all of2013. One factor is a
flood of money coming in from overseas.
Developers are benefiting from investors
from China, Russia, Brazil and other countries where wealthy people are looking for
a relatively safe place to park their money.
New York city’s steadily rising property
prices are still seen as a relative bargain
when compared with London and Hong
Kong, says Stuart Saft, a real-estate lawyer
at Holland & Knight.
The sudden spike is largely attributable
to a clause in the city’scomplicated property-tax code, which taxes different types of
abode at different rates, and favours homeowners at the expense of renters. In order
to reduce taxes on the construction of new
multi-family high-rises—which tend to be
taxed at especially high rates—developers
rely on something called the 421-a programme, which exemptsnewconstruction
from property taxes for decades on the
condition that they also build some more
affordable units, and is yet to be renewed
by the state legislature.
Launched in 1971asa wayto spurinvestment in what was then a rather decrepit
city, it has since helped generate around
251,000 of the city’s 2.2m rental units, a significant share—approximately 35%—of
new construction in the city, according to
an analysis from the New School in New
York. This includes an estimated 37,400 affordable units, mostly in Brooklyn, as of
2013. The fact that this benefit could disappear in 2016 helps explain why so many
developers are rushing to break ground
now. “We’ve been working day and night
to getthe permitsin time,” saysOmri Sachs
of Adam America, a developer with several big projects in Brooklyn.
The 421-a scheme costs the city an estimated $1.1 billion in lost tax revenue every
year, making it a pricey way to build new
housing. The developers of One57 quali-
fied for the tax-break by subsidising 66 affordable flats in the Bronx. This and other
subsidies will cost the city nearly $66m in
forgone property-tax revenue over ten
years for this building alone, according to
the Independent Budget Office (IBO). 
The IBO is quick to say that properties
like One57 are hardly representative of the
scheme’s recipients. Most developers argue that the city’s runaway land prices and
high construction costs make big rental
projectsunfeasible withouttaxbreaks. The
cost of buildable land below 96th Street in
Manhattan has risen nearly 80% since 2011,
according to Cushman & Wakefield, a realestate firm. It then takes another three
years, on average, to get something built.
Charging rents high enough to make a pro-
fit is hard enough: add property taxes,
A rule, supporters ofthe Republican Party tend to dislike losingelections to Democrats. Bearthis in mind as opinion polls
emerge, suggesting that Donald Trump may have peaked as a
front-runner among Republican presidential hopefuls.
The Trump surge was always likely to slow at some point because most Republican activists—for all their bluster about the
two parties’ rulingelitesbeingasbad aseach other—would rather
win the 2016 election than see President Hillary Clinton sitting in
the Oval Office. Though Mr Trump for a while seemed to defy the
laws of political gravity, surviving gaffes and rows that would
have brought other candidates to earth, most conservatives already knew that the splenetic property tycoon is unelectable
(thanks to the size of the field, he has routinely led with the backing ofjust one in four Republicans).
That does not mean that party grandees can relax, for they
have not seen the last ofthe anger that has fuelled the Trump run.
Fed-up grassroots conservatives remain sure that Barack Obama
is bent on destroying their country and cannot understand why
Republican leaders have not done more to thwart his agenda despite controlling both chambers of Congress. They are reluctant
to accept that governing in a large, messy democracy involves
compromise, or that the concerns of hard-core conservatives do
not always enjoy majority support. They are quickto believe that
their elites have been bought by corrupt special interests. Mr
Trump has sought to fuel those suspicions, boasting that his cash
allows him to boss politicians of both parties around. His particular genius has been to offer cynical voters not reform, but his
own services as a leader too rich and clever to be suborned.
Some Trump fans simply relish the skunk-at-a-picnic aspects
ofhis presidential bid. They do not care that his policy platform is
a mess of boastfulness and absurdity (his plan for Islamic State:
“We go in, we knock the hell out of ’em, we take the oil”). They
cheer every time Senator This or Governor That—not to mention
the mainstream media—is left spluttering by his outbursts. At the
RedState Gathering, a conservative forum held in Atlanta from
August 6th-8th after the first televised presidential debate in
Cleveland, a dismaying number of activists saw nothing wrong
with Mr Trump’s repeated assertion that the Mexican government deliberately sends criminals north across the border, and
gets away with it because American politicians are “stupid”. Nor
did activists quibble with his fantastical solution: a border wall,
for which a President Trump would make Mexico pay.
Though nine presidential candidates addressed the RedState
forum, Mr Trump’s invitation was torn up after he launched a series of attacks on Megyn Kelly, a Fox News presenter and debate
co-host. Ms Kelly had asked him in Cleveland whether his record
ofcalling women who cross him “fat pigs” and “dogs” might help
Democrats paint Republicans as anti-woman. On the night, an
audience of 24m Americans watched Mr Trump offer a snarling
response about political correctness. Over the next few days he
seemed—to many ears—to suggest that Ms Kelly’s thinking had
been clouded by menstruation.
Yet a straw poll ofactivists at RedState suggests that what really upset them was Mr Trump’s disloyalty. They were aghast that,
in the debate’s opening moments, Mr Trump declined to pledge
hissupportforwhomeverbecomesthe Republican nominee and
then refused to rule out an independent run for the presidency,
explaining that this would give him “a lot ofleverage”.
An ex-cop who owns a security business in Dahlonega, Georgia, recalled voting for the third-party candidacy of another billionaire populist, Ross Perot, in the presidential election of 1992,
only to watch Bill Clinton win the White House for the Democrats and deny George H.W. Bush a second term. Vowing never to
make that mistake again, the former policeman said he is now
lookingfora Republican candidate who isveryconservative “but
electable”. The ex-cop, like many of the activists gathered in Atlanta, favours Senator Ted Cruz ofTexas, a hardliner who fired up
the crowd by denouncing his Republican colleagues in Congress
as a self-serving “Washington cartel”. A county official from Mobile, Alabama, predicted that: “People are angry enough with
what is happening in the country that they’ll vote for Ted Cruz.”
To be fair, RedState gatherings attract a particularly flinty sort
of conservative. In other forums, more pragmatic candidates
have received good reviews for their first TV debate performances, among them Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Carly
Fiorina, the former boss of Hewlett-Packard, a technology firm
(who dominated a separate debate for candidates who did not
poll well enough to make the main show). But Republicans of all
stripes agree that the 2016 campaign is unfolding in an angry
country. They give credit to Mr Trump for tapping into a mood of
grievance, and suggest that a clever conservative can now harness that emotion to unify a broad electoral coalition on the right.
We want our country back
That is too glib. Mr Trump’s most loyal supporters—white men
withoutcollege degrees—have much to be crossabout. They have
lost economic and social power, thanks partly to global competition and automation but also to feminism and civil rights. All politicians know they cannot ignore the pain ofthose who have lost
their jobs. Mr Trump offers simple, dazzling solutions, involving
fines for firms that ship jobs abroad, or promises to use his dealmaking savvy to transform trade relations with China. But some
voter anger—notably towards professional women and nonwhites—is illegitimate. Strikingly, when RedState activists were
read some of the furious e-mails sent to protest against Mr
Trump’s exclusion, many called Ms Kelly a whore or a lesbian
and called the man in the White House a “nigger”. Ugly forms of
rage are in the air, and will survive a Trump slump. For Republicans seeking to craft nationwide majorities, anger is also a trap
weird tropical flower, the Palace of
the Light of Faith opens to subjects of
the Sultan of Brunei for three days each
year. It is a 1,800-room pile on the edge of
Bandar Seri Begawan, the tiny state’s
sleepy capital. In its vast banqueting hall
thousands of Bruneians tuck into a breakfast of beef curry and honey-roast chicken,
piled up on gold-rimmed plates. Later, the
men queue to greet the sultan in a greenand-gold reception room (the sultan’s wife
receives the women in a separate chamber). The royal family shakes tens of thousands ofhands.
This annual event, held last month to
celebrate the end of Ramadan, is a chance
for Bruneians to praise Sultan Hassanal
Bolkiah, one of the world’s richest men
and few remaining absolute monarchs.
They will have another chance on August
15th, when he marks his 69th birthday. 
Bountiful oil has made Bruneians the
fourth most wealthy people in Asia, with
generous state handouts. That has helped
forestall criticism of an autocratic government. But now reserves of hydrocarbons
are dwindling, to which the government
seems to have few answers—other than
fostering a harsher form of Islam. Last year
it announced plans to introduce a severe
form of sharia (Islamic law). 
Perched on the northern coast of the island of Borneo, surrounded to landward
by Malaysia, Brunei gained full
se prime ministers on every tenth
anniversary ofthe second world war’s
end, Shinzo Abe will issue a statement
about the war on or before August15th,
the date ofJapan’s capitulation in 1945.
It has been the subject offevered
speculation. Advisers had at one point
said that the prime minister, a man of
true not manufactured feelings, was not
minded simply to repeat by rote the
earlier “heartfelt apology” for Japan’s
“colonial rule and aggression” ofa socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama,
in 1995 and Junichiro Koizumi, a conservative, a decade ago. Mr Abe does not
thinkimperial Japan did much wrong
that other warring nations did not do,
and he believes that a gruel ofJapanese
guilt and apologies has been a poor diet
for Japanese now lacking a sense of pride
and patriotism.
And so a lot ofpeople, from Chinese
and South Korean leaders to Western
academics, have been worried sickabout
what he might say. Yet as one ofhis people puts it, rather condescendingly, Mr
Abe has recently grown up as a politician—that is, his political head has
overridden his heart. Besides, he may
have struggled to breakout ofwhat are
now accepted global norms about how
leaders are meant to deal with the politics ofthe past, including apologies.
The indications are that Mr Abe will
hew more closely to the spirit and perhaps the content ofpast prime ministerial statements than many dared think,
even ifsome quibbling over terms may
still be divined. He may well affix the full
authority ofthe cabinet to his statement.
He may even manage to kickthe whole
apology debate into the long grass. 
Mr Abe would have to say something
pretty shocking for a recent ifmild improvement in ties with China and South
Korea to be set back. Some months ago
President Xi Jinping ofChina decided to
bring Mr Abe in from the cold, perhaps
because ofconcerns about the impact of
sundered relations on the Chinese economy. South Korea’s president, ParkGeunhye, quickly followed, sensing the risks
ofbeing left out ofa Sino-Japanese
love-in. A meeting in Beijing between the
Chinese and Japanese leaders now looks
likely—though not before Mr Xi’s grandiose military parade, marking the war’s
end, on September 3rd. Mr Abe and Ms
Parkcould meet after that. Yet relations
will remain fragile, susceptible especially
to Chinese whim.
Other initiatives are encouraging. In
July Chinese forced in the war to labour
for Mitsubishi accepted an apology and
compensation from the Japanese conglomerate—a first. And though South
Korea had at first objected to Japan’s
application for world-heritage status
from UNESCO for a remarkable set of
Meiji-era sites that were vital to Japan’s
early industrialisation—Koreans had later
been forced to workat some ofthem,
including on Hashima island with its coal
mine, below—the two countries negotiated a deal. Japan acknowledged the forced
labour, and South Korea backed the
successful bid.
